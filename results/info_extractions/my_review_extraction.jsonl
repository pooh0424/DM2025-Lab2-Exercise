Star Razaaq Adoti can’t \nblame his agent, as it was the actor himself who scripted this Nigeria-set revenge \nthriller, in which his former special forces soldier makes a Jack Carter-like return \nto wreak havoc on the mean streets of Lagos. \nZion (Adoti) has made the US his home after being dishonourably discharged and \ndoing a stretch in the slammer. But he makes a beeline for Lagos when he \nreceives an SOS message from his sister Ronke (Sharon Rotimi), a hotel \nchambermaid who stumbles on respectable medical professional cum evil drug \nkingpin Dr Baptiste (Philip Asaya) as he murders a sex worker. Zion is too late: \nRonke is a goner, framed as another victim of the fentanyl cocktail Matrix that’s \ndoing the rounds, courtesy of the bad doctor. Time for Zion to dust off his \nparticular set of skills. \nThese turn out in large part to be him walking obliviously into ill-advised locales \nand getting an absolute beating. But despite Zion’s boneheaded brand of \nheroism, a lot of plot-facilitating character choices and outbreaks of ripe \nNollywood acting, British-Chinese director Chee Keong Cheung delivers a pretty \nsatisfying and fleet-footed ride here. All the more so for going fairly skimpy on the \ncharacterisation in the manner of 80s action flicks: Zion gets a cute street urchin \nsidekick (Ijelu Folajimi), just so we know he’s on the side of the angels. \nEven Zion’s inexplicably haphazard street smarts line up somehow with the \nshambolic, brutal world he infiltrates: an impressive selection of immolations,\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n**Page 2**\\n\"\"\"\\nbludgeonings and machete-gougings is meted out once he teams up with albino \nganglord Jagunlabi (Damilola Ogunsi). Cheung’s direction matches it with gusto, \nrecalling City of God in a colourful handheld blitz – though his fondness for the \nDutch angle gets a bit annoying. He uses it so often they’ll have to rename it the \nNigerian angle, but his film has got an undeniable gangsta lean. \nSon of the Soil is in UK cinemas from 5 December.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n", "document_id": "doc_4c14c4c8"}
