      "*   **Evolving LLM Landscape:** The LLM field is rapidly evolving. New models are released frequently, and existing ones are updated. A flexible protocol can adapt to these changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What MCP Protocol Aims to Do:**\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP Protocol aims to provide a **unified interface and a set of conventions** for interacting with LLMs. Key aspects include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Standardized API:** It defines a common set of API calls and data structures that applications can use to send requests to and receive responses from any LLM that adheres to the protocol. This abstracts away the specific API details of individual LLMs.\n",
      "2.  **Model Abstraction:** It treats LLMs as interchangeable components. An application can request a specific type of task (e.g., \"generate text,\" \"answer a question\") without needing to know the underlying model's architecture or specific implementation.\n",
      "3.  **Orchestration and Routing:** MCP Protocol can facilitate the intelligent routing of requests to the most suitable LLM for a given task. This could involve:\n",
      "    *   **Task-specific routing:** Sending a summarization request to a model known for its summarization capabilities.\n",
      "    *   **Load balancing:** Distributing requests across multiple instances of the same or different LLMs to manage load.\n",
      "    *   **Chaining models:** Combining the outputs of multiple LLMs in a sequence to achieve a more complex outcome.\n",
      "4.  **Resource Management:** It can help in managing the computational resources required by different LLMs, optimizing their deployment and utilization.\n",
      "5.  **Interoperability:** It enables seamless integration of different LLMs within a single application or system, fostering a more modular and flexible AI ecosystem.\n",
      "6.  **Model Governance and Monitoring:** Potentially, it could also include mechanisms for monitoring LLM performance, tracking usage, and enforcing policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Analogy:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine you're building a smart home system. You want to control lights, thermostats, and speakers from different manufacturers. Without a standard protocol (like Zigbee or Z-Wave), you'd need a separate app and integration for each device. MCP Protocol is like that standard protocol for LLMs, allowing your \"smart home\" application to interact with various \"smart devices\" (LLMs) in a consistent way.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Benefits of MCP Protocol:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Reduced Development Complexity:** Developers can build applications that are less dependent on specific LLMs, making it easier to switch or upgrade models.\n",
      "*   **Increased Flexibility and Agility:** Applications can dynamically choose the best LLM for a given task or adapt to new LLM releases.\n",
      "*   **Improved Resource Utilization:** Efficiently managing and routing requests can lead to better use of computational resources.\n",
      "*   **Enhanced Collaboration:** Enables LLMs to work together, creating more powerful and sophisticated AI systems.\n",
      "*   **Future-Proofing:** Makes applications more resilient to changes in the LLM landscape.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Where is MCP Protocol Used?**\n",
      "\n",
      "While \"MCP Protocol\" might not be a single, universally adopted standard with a formal RFC document like HTTP, the *concept* is being implemented and explored in various ways by:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **LLM Orchestration Platforms:** Frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, and others are building functionalities that embody the principles of MCP Protocol, allowing developers to chain and manage multiple LLMs.\n",
      "*   **AI Infrastructure Providers:** Companies building platforms for deploying and managing LLMs are likely to incorporate such protocols to offer a unified experience.\n",
      "*   **Research and Development:** The academic and research community is actively exploring standardized ways to interact with and combine LLMs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, MCP Protocol is a conceptual framework and a set of emerging practices aimed at standardizing the interaction and management of multiple large language models, making them more interoperable, efficient, and easier to integrate into complex AI systems.**\n",
      "logs: {'model': 'gemini-2.5-flash-lite', 'input_tokens': 16, 'output_tokens': 1072}\n",
      "--- MODEL: gemini-2.5-pro ---\n",
      "Of course. Let's break down the \"MCP Protocol\" in the context of large language models.\n",
      "\n",
      "First and most importantly, it's crucial to understand that the **\"MCP Protocol\" is not a formal, standardized industry protocol** like TCP/IP or HTTP. Instead, it's a **conceptual framework or a metaphor** used to describe a sophisticated way of orchestrating AI systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The name is often a nod to the \"Master Control Program\" from the movie *Tron*, an all-powerful program that controlled and managed other programs within its system. In the context of LLMs, it represents a similar hierarchical structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Core Idea: From a Single Brain to a Team of Specialists\n",
      "\n",
      "A single, monolithic LLM (like a base GPT-4 or Claude 3) is incredibly powerful, but it has limitations. It's a generalist. It can write code, but a specialized coding model might be better. It can analyze data, but it can't run a database query on its own.\n",
      "\n",
      "The **MCP (Master/Manager Controller Protocol) framework** proposes a solution: instead of relying on one model, you create a system where a \"master\" LLM acts as a manager or orchestrator for a team of other, more specialized models or tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's break down the acronym in this context:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **M - Master / Meta / Manager:** This is a primary, high-level LLM. Its main job is not to do the work itself, but to **reason, plan, and delegate**.\n",
      "*   **C - Controller / Coordinator:** This LLM controls the workflow. It takes a complex user request, breaks it down into smaller, manageable sub-tasks, and sends those tasks to the appropriate specialist.\n",
      "*   **P - Protocol / Process:** This refers to the set of rules and communication methods the system uses. It defines how the Master Controller sends instructions to the specialists and how they report back their results. This includes things like API calls, function calling formats (e.g., JSON), and managing the flow of information.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Components of an MCP-like System\n",
      "\n",
      "An AI system built on this concept would typically have:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **The Orchestrator (The \"MCP\"):** A powerful reasoning LLM (like GPT-4, Claude 3 Opus, or Gemini Advanced). Its job is to:\n",
      "    *   **Deconstruct:** Analyze the user's prompt and break it down into a logical sequence of steps.\n",
      "    *   **Delegate:** Identify the best \"worker\" for each step.\n",
      "    *   **Synthesize:** Collect the results from all the workers and assemble them into a final, coherent answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Specialist Models / Agents:** These are the \"workers.\" They are often smaller, fine-tuned models or other AI systems that excel at one specific task.\n",
      "    *   **Example:** A code generation model (e.g., a fine-tuned Code Llama).\n",
      "    *   **Example:** A data analysis model that understands SQL and Python data frames.\n",
      "    *   **Example:** An image generation model (e.g., Stable Diffusion or DALL-E 3).\n",
      "    *   **Example:** A model fine-tuned on legal documents for contract review.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Tools (APIs and Functions):** These are non-LLM resources that the system can use to interact with the outside world or perform calculations.\n",
      "    *   **Web Search API:** To get real-time information.\n",
      "    *   **Calculator:** For precise mathematical calculations.\n",
      "    *   **Code Interpreter:** To run Python code in a sandboxed environment.\n",
      "    *   **Database Connection:** To query a company's internal sales data.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### How It Works: A Step-by-Step Example\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine you give the system this complex prompt:\n",
      "\n",
      "> \"Analyze our Q3 sales data from the company database, identify the top 3 performing products, create a bar chart visualizing their revenue, and write a summary email to the sales team.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A single LLM would struggle with this. An MCP system would handle it like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Deconstruction (MCP):** The Master Controller analyzes the prompt and breaks it into four distinct tasks:\n",
      "    *   Task 1: Access the database and retrieve Q3 sales data.\n",
      "    *   Task 2: Analyze the data to find the top 3 products.\n",
      "    *   Task 3: Generate a bar chart from this data.\n",
      "    *   Task 4: Draft a summary email incorporating the findings and the chart.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Delegation (MCP):** The controller routes each task to the best tool/agent:\n",
      "    *   **Task 1 -> Database Tool:** It calls a function to execute an SQL query on the company database.\n",
      "    *   **Task 2 -> Data Analysis Agent:** It sends the retrieved data to a specialist model (or uses its own logic) to process the numbers.\n",
      "    *   **Task 3 -> Code Interpreter Tool:** It instructs a code interpreter to generate a bar chart using a library like Matplotlib and save it as an image.\n",
      "    *   **Task 4 -> Itself or a Writing Agent:** It takes the results from the previous steps to draft the email.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Synthesis (MCP):** The Master Controller receives the results: the list of top products, the generated chart image, and the drafted text. It then assembles them into a final, complete response for the user.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Why is this Concept Important?\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Overcomes Limitations:** It allows AI systems to perform complex, multi-step tasks that a single model cannot.\n",
      "2.  **Specialization and Accuracy:** It uses the best tool for the job, leading to more accurate and efficient results (e.g., a calculator is always better at math than an LLM).\n",
      "3.  **Modularity:** You can easily add new tools or specialist agents to the system without having to retrain the entire thing.\n",
      "4.  **Cost-Effectiveness:** Using smaller, specialized models for specific tasks can be much cheaper than running a massive, general-purpose model for everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Real-World Connections\n",
      "\n",
      "While \"MCP Protocol\" is a conceptual term, the underlying idea is being actively developed and implemented in several ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Multi-Agent Systems (e.g., AutoGPT, BabyAGI):** These are early, experimental examples of autonomous agents that try to create and manage their own tasks to achieve a goal.\n",
      "*   **Function Calling & Tool Use:** This is the most practical and widely used implementation of this concept. Major models from OpenAI (GPT), Google (Gemini), and Anthropic (Claude) have built-in capabilities to call external functions and tools, allowing them to act as orchestrators.\n",
      "*   **Frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex:** These are software libraries that provide developers with the \"protocol\" and building blocks to create their own MCP-like applications by chaining together LLMs, tools, and data sources.\n",

      "\t\t Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed, ML algorithms use statistical techniques to enable systems to 'learn' from data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions without human intervention. \n",

      "\t Types of Machine Learning \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Common types include supervised learning (learning from labeled data), unsupervised learning (finding patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error with rewards and penalties). \n",

They are designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. LLMs are characterized by their enormous size (billions or trillions of parameters) and their ability to perform a wide variety of natural language processing tasks. \n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

And also the process of projecting high-dimensional embeddings down to a 2D visualization inevitably loses some information, which can make distinct clusters appear to overlap."

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
